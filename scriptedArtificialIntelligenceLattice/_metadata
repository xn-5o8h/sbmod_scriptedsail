For now, chips using a lot of custom stuffs like A.V.I.A.N. don't work properly with it.\nAlso, since FU has this mod in it's includes[], it makes the game ignore this mod's priority, and results in a new load order where some specie mods are loaded after this, and thus aren't patched.\nTL;DR, species that were supported by this mod before might now go into failsafe mode directly. Please post those there! http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/947429656/2119355556498832921/\n\n[u][b][h1]Short description:[/h1][/b][/u]\n[b]Good stuff:[/b]\n- Allows you to easily change your ship's S.A.I.L. with A.I. chips, which can also easily be created by other modders\n- Each chip slot overwrites it's left neightbors, which allows for multiple chip combos \n  (Eg. A.V.I.A.N.'s dialogs with the Felin's visuals, or the old Hylotl A.I. with japanese dialogs)\n- You can get more A.I. chips in the collection this mod's in (the link's just above), or with this mod:\n   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947922190\n- Allows to change the object's sprite to any other installed techstation\n(you gotta spawn them (for now), eg. /spawnitem aviantechstation)\n- It should work with any specie and ship on the workshop! If not, you're going to see a big \"FAILSAFE ACTIVATED\" when interacting with S.A.I.L.; please do tell which specie you're using in the forum thingy below so that I can make a patch for it! ( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/947429656/2119355556498832921/ )\n\n[b]\"Bad\" stuff:[/b]\n- It won't change radiomessages (bottom-left corner messages, eg. in missions) because starbound doesn't allow me to do this\n- It *should* display your missions properly, but if it doesn't you can use the \"Fallback\" S.A.I.L. (the vanilla one) which'll see all your missions via the button in the settings window. Please do tell in the forum thingy bellow what quests aren't displaying, and if possible from what mod, so that I can patch them in! (The failsafe will last until you quit your ship)\n- If for some reasons your ship pet is outdated, chances are it'll crash the techstation, and thus this mod won't save the tech chips. If that happens, please do tell it in the discussion thingy and I'll make a fix for it!\n\n[b]Multiplayer compatible / \"vanilla friendly\":[/b]\nProbably needs everyone involved to have the mod installed for it to work in multiplayer.\n\n\n[u][b][h1]Long description:[/h1][/b][/u]\n(just look for the gifs really)\n\nI took the hardcoded vanilla S.A.I.L. interface and rewrote it's logic in Lua, thus giving me the ability to add some fancy features, but most notably, to allow easy S.A.I.L. changes and modding via config chips. (it also has some cool animations for buttons)\n\nMore specifically, this S.A.I.L. will take it's configuration from the defaults, then from the specie's defaults, then from each of it's A.I. chip slots. Each of these configuration is merged, where latest overwrites oldest if configs 'collide'. This allows, for example, to have that cute Felin S.A.I.L. overwrite the appearance of A.V.I.A.N., that overwrites the dialogs of your vanilla yellow glitch bald thingy.\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/E3qkZ2A.gif[/img]\nThe mod itself comes with chips to change the appearance to the older S.A.I.L. versions, but I've stolen (literally) a good load of other mods' S.A.I.L.s and made chips for them there: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943637272\n\nI've also added a kind-of-still-WIP (it works but I'm not sure of the implementation) ability to change the appearance of the S.A.I.L. object itself to another one, with it's animations and everything. It should work with any techstation you can find that is somewhat similar to the vanilla one, but you'll probably need to spawn it yourself via an admin command.\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/gzgHir6.gif[/img]\n\n[u][b][h1]This mod has some caveats though[/h1][/b][/u]\nThe main one is the fact that we cannot read the player's available missions via Lua. Because of this, this S.A.I.L. have to \"guess\" which missions the player has, based on their quests.\nFrom what I've tested this works okay, but it means that I have to manually add the quest <-> mission thing in some table. (tho if I ever stop updating it, it's quite easy to patch them in yourself)\nIn case of it not seeing a mission, I've set up a \"fallback to vanilla S.A.I.L.\" button that will temporarily bring back the old S.A.I.L., which will see all of your quests. (It'll go back to the scripted version once you quit then come back to your ship!)\nHopefully we'll have the required Lua bindings soon.......\n\nAnother problem is that the radiomessage thingies' face are hardcoded and I cannot easily script them. This means that, even if you have a cute anime S.A.I.L. in your ship, when you run down the lunar base, the good ol' bald S.A.I.L. will appear to notify you of the danger.\n\nIf you want to go multiplayer with this, everyone participating will probably have to download this mod, and the S.A.I.L. config chips you've subscribed to; or they'll crash when entering your ship.\n\n[u][b][h1]Possible incompatibilities:[/h1][/b][/u]\n- this mod overwrites /quests/scripts/main.lua and /quests/scripts/portraits.lua. Any mod that does the same will result in one of the two mod's script to not exist. Likely the others', since this mod loads after a lot of mods and thus has more chances to overwrite stuff. Regardless, this is a pretty non-critical component so nothing very big will break.\nThe only mod I know that does this is the A.V.I.A.N. S.A.I.L., but I forgot what it does with it.\nIf this mod script is overwritten, it'll result in S.A.I.L.'s icon in the quest log to not match your custom S.A.I.L..\n\n- Any mod that touches the vanilla interface might make the \"failsafe S.A.I.L.\" look different.\n\n- Any mod that overwrites /ai/*.png and /ai/portraits/*.png might result in missmatching S.A.I.L. visuals.\n\n- Playing with FU and as a specie from Gyrusens+, The Pony Modpack, Batong Vampire, Avali or Phox Race, and using the specie's techstation instead of FU's techstation might leave you with the vanilla failsafe S.A.I.L. and I don't think I can do anything about it (because those mods include FU, which includes this mod, which means I can't include them, otherwise Starbound will crash). Your only hope is to spawn another techstation; safe bets are any of the vanilla ones (\"humantechstation\", \"aviantechstation\" etc.), FU's techstation (\"fu_byostechstation\"), and this mod's techstation that I was using for tests (\"customtechstation\"). To spawn a techstation, type[code]\n/admin\n/spawnitem customtechstation 1  '{\"unbreakable\": true}'\n/admin\n[/code]\nTo break the default unbreakable techstation, hover over it with your cursor, then type [code]\n/admin\n/entityeval object.smash()\n/admin\n[/code]\n\n- (temporary) Again, FU has their own S.A.I.L. interface now, and when using this mod for customization along with FU, some chips (like A.V.I.A.N.) don't work properly currently. This is being worked on!\n\nThat should be everything. Sorry for the inconveniences!\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Storm_UK and his hobo.lua script, Magicks and the others at the starbound discord's modding channel, and all the people I stole their S.A.I.L. from who haven't killed me yet.\n(And you for using this?!!)\n\n\nAlso available on github: https://github.com/xn-5o8h/sbmod_scriptedsail\nIf you wanna make your own A.I. chip, here's a template: https://github.com/xn-5o8h/sbmod_scriptedsail_templateaichip/releases",
